# Patient-Readmission-Predictor-
🏥 Diabetes Readmission Prediction
📌 Project Overview

Hospital readmissions are costly and often preventable.
This project analyzes diabetic patient data to predict the likelihood of 30-day hospital readmission, helping healthcare providers identify high-risk patients and improve post-discharge care.

The goal is to demonstrate end-to-end data analytics and machine learning skills, from data cleaning to actionable insights.

🎯 Problem Statement

Diabetic patients have a high rate of hospital readmission due to complications and inconsistent follow-up care.
Accurately predicting readmission risk can:

Reduce healthcare costs

Improve patient outcomes

Support data-driven clinical decisions

This project builds predictive models to identify patients at higher risk of readmission.
